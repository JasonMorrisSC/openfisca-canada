# Explanation Demonstration

explanation.py demonstrates how you can use the output of the Web API's `/trace`
endpoint to generate tree-structured explanations that allow the front end to
illustrate what is known, what is not known, why, and how, in as much detail
or simplicity as is preferred by the application developer.
