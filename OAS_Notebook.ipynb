        "Why not take out the middle man, and say that if 3(1)(a-c) are true then the legal conclusion holds?\n",
        "\n",
        "You can, and depending on what kinds of questions you want your code to be able to answer, that might be appropriate and sufficient. But from a Rules as Code perspective, we are encoding legislation in advance of knowing what purpose the encoding is going to be put to. So what we should aspire to do is to encode information that answers as many questions that the law is capable of answering as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you know for a fact that your app is only ever going to want to know whether a Person is eligible for a full monthly pension, then there is no reason to divide the rule into two Variables. (Indeed, as you will see, we are going to divide section 3(1) into **many** OpenFisca Variables, not just two.)\n",
        "\n",
        "But, perhaps you would like to be able to answer the question: \"How did the person qualify for a full monthly pension?\" It may be that there are other sections of the law that *also* qualify someone for full monthly pension. In which case, we are going to have to amend the formula for that legal conclusion to add those other sections. But by also encoding which sections were triggered separately from what conclusions arise as a result, we have access to variables that can show how OpenFisca reached that conclusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "It also allows us to run simulations and ask questions like \"are there any people who qualify for the pension under section 3, but not under the other section?\" That allows us to determine whether section 3 even matters, or if it is entirely duplicate to the other section that reaches the same conclusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "So the objective of this Rules as Code style encoding is to reflect as much inforamtion about the law in the encoding as you can, because you don't know in advance which questions will be relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "That increases the difficulty of doing the encoding, but increases the number of purposes to which the encoding can be put.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using OpenFisca for Reasons\n",
        "\n",
        "Using this approach to get OpenFisca to give you reasons for legal conclusions has some advantages and disadvantages over other approaches. One disadvantage, is that you cannot simply ask OpenFisca \"why\" something is true, or not true. Instead, you have to ask it to calculate all of the variables that might have been relevant. Which means that the programmer needs to know in advance which variables those are. That defeats the objective of obscuring from the application developer how the RUles as Code implementation does its calculations.  Also, the information is calculated as a set of true or false values for each node of the legislation, but the answer received from the API doesn't include information about how those nodes are connected, and which results triggered which other results. Reconstructing that information on the applicaiton end will again require the developer to be aware of the structure of the act, which again defeats the purpose of avoiding the need for the application developer to know how the Act works.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, OpenFisca does have the advantage that as long as you ask for a Variable, it will be provided if it can be calculated. Which means that unlike some logic-based programming approaches to encoding legislation, OpenFisca is capable of advising the user if the same conclusion can be reached in multiple ways."

The person amending the encoding to match the amendments to the law may not realize that something was left out of the original encoding, and the logical effect of amending only the first part may not be what was expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, if later you discover that you want to have answers to questions like \"why, under section 3(1)(b)(i) did the person qualify\", you can take the elements that are being considered inside the formula only, and turn them into variables. If that happens, having the correct structure of logic in your formula, even if it is slightly redundant, will make it easier to implement the logic as a set of variables that matches the text of the law, which in turn will make the explanations created by those variables more consistent with what the law says.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indeed, you can see that the \"not a pensioner\" requirement in 3(1)(b)(i) is also redundant in the same way, because it is dealt with in section 3(1)(a), and 3(1)(a) and 3(1)(b) are disjoint.
