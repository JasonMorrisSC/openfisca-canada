# TODO: Find out if we want to model requests to cancel, suspend and renew pensions in 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3. I think not.

# Request that pension cease to be payable
# 9.1 (1) Any pensioner may make a request to the Minister in writing that 
# their pension cease to be payable.
# When pension ceases to be payable
# (2) A pension shall cease to be payable on the last day of the month in which 
# the Minister approves a request under subsection (1).
# Request for reinstatement
# (3) A pensioner whose pension has ceased to be payable under subsection (2) 
# may make a request in writing to the Minister that their pension be reinstated.
# When reinstatement effective
# (4) A pension shall be reinstated and payment shall commence in the month 
# following the month in which the Minister receives a request under subsection (3) 
# or in the month chosen by the pensioner in the request, whichever is later.
